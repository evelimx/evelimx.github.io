I was a master's student in the [Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP) lab](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) of the University of Toronto, advised by [Prof. Tovi Grossman](https://www.tovigrossman.com) and [Dr. MaurÃ­cio Sousa](https://mauriciosousa.github.io/). During my master's, I have worked with [Prof. Takeo Igarashi](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/), [Prof. Christian Sandor](https://drsandor.net/) and [Dr. Anran Qi](https://anranqi.github.io/) at the University of Tokyo. Before joining DGP, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo with the co-op program.
